Car Sales Analysis Dashboards - Power BI Project


Overview
This project is a comprehensive Power BI solution designed to analyze car sales trends and customer demographics. The dashboards provide interactive visualizations and key insights to help decision-makers identify key performance drivers, monitor sales growth, and improve operational efficiency.

The project demonstrates a wide range of Power BI skills, including data transformation with Power Query, the creation of calculated measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), and the use of dynamic filtering with slicers and filters.


Project Goals
